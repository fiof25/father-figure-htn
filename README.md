### Inspiration 🧑‍🧒
"Absent fatherhood has made a ripple in my life" - Richard Li

Father Figure is not just another Chrome extension... It is a friend, a father and a way to make your doomscrolling even just a little less lonely. 😞

### What it does 🛠️
Take your pick: Meet Bill ⚽️, Chang 🍎, or Dave ☕️

Whether it's the warm red-necked love of Bill, the tough-love Asian dad who loves you but won't say it outloud, or the sweetest and most understanding Dave (who will listen to all your problems no matter what) -- Father Figure is here to check up on you, remind you of important events, remind you to eat, sleep, maybe go outside once in a while and crack a dad joke or two whenever you feel down... Need some advice? Feeling stressed? Want to play a game of chess? Need a confidence boost? No problem, because Dad is here for you no matter what. ❤️

### How we built it 🦺
Designed different personas that were composed of hand-drawn characters with different emotions
Created custom event triggers for Dave to pop up on (e.g. tab overload, late night, emotional check-ins)
Used Gemini AI to generate conversation and different personalities + ElevenLabs API to simulate dad voice
Challenges we ran into but conquered successfully 🥊
Format... we weren't sure how we would display things to ensure convenience and seamlessness, but thank goodness it all worked out
Timing the animation and audio correctly for maximum dad-ness 😅

### Accomplishments that our fathers are proud of us for 👏
Cute and charming animations to spice up your browser 😉
Connecting to the APIs despite some security issues...
Getting into this hackathon in the first place
### What we learned 👨‍🏫
Building a Chrome extension from scratch
Alternative methods to get around the content security policy of specific features...
How to lock in even when co-op applications are due in 2 days 🥶
What's next for Father Figure ⏭️
Introduce more father personalities, turn it into a macOS, Windows, and Linux extension to take with you everywhere (as not just a Chrome Browser!)
